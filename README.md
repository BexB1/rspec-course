# rspec-course

This project is ongoing practice in the writing of code tests using [rspec](https://rspec.info/)

## Installation and running

You'll need Ruby on your local machine.

1. Clone the repo, cd into the `spec` folder and install the gems with `bundle i`.
2. You don't need to run the Rails server: just use the `rspec` command followed by a file name to run the tests. You can run all tests at once with `rspec .`
